// Now that you can add characters to your team letâ€™s focus on displaying and managing them within your applicationâ€™s interface.
// First, verify if your team array has any characters in it. If the team array length is 0, display Pick some team members! in the UI.
// If there are characters in your team, display each one in the UI. 
// For each character in the team array, show their name, image, price, strength, and agility. Follow the same pattern you used to display the array of all characters.

// Display the teamâ€™s total strength: In this step, youâ€™ll create a variable to keep track of the total strength of your team and display it in the UI.
// Create a regular variable named totalStrength. This does not need to be a state variable.
// Calculate the total strength of the team and assign it to the totalStrength variable. 
// This calculation should sum up the strength values of all characters currently on the team!
// Show the value of totalStrength in the UI. If the team array is empty, totalStrength should be 0.

// ðŸ§  Why doesnâ€™t totalStrength need to be a state variable? 
// Recall that every time a component is re-rendered in React, the code in that component re-runs. 
// When the component re-renders, we can calculate the total strength of the team based on the data from the team state at that time.
// If the team state changes, a re-render will be triggered, and totalStrength will be recalculated with the new team data.
// Put another way, the only reason to create state variables is to use them to trigger re-renders or persist data between re-renders. 
// Creating unneeded state variables only serves to add unnecessary complications.

// With this in mind, what value are we holding in state now that could also be a regular variable? 
// You donâ€™t need to refactor your existing code to remove it from state - just identifying it is valuable.

// Display the teamâ€™s total agility: Create a variable for the total agility of your team and display this value in the UI.
// Create a variable named totalAgility. Just like with totalStrength, this should not be a state variable.
// Just like with strength, calculate the total agility of the team and assign it to the totalAgility variable. 
// This should be the sum of the team membersâ€™ agility values.
// The value of totalAgility should be displayed in the UI. As with strength, if your team is empty, totalAgility will be 0.
// Add a Remove button to each of the characters on your team. 
// This button, when clicked, should call a handler function to remove the character from your team.

// Create a function named handleRemoveFighter(). It should accept a fighter object as an argument. 
// This handler function is key to managing your team. 
// This function enables you to remove characters and adjust your total money.
// This function will be executed when you click the Remove button for a character in your team.
// In the function, determine which character needs to be removed based on user interaction 
// (This will look very similar to what you did in the handleAddFighter() function).
// Once the character to be removed is identified, the team state should be updated to exclude this character. 
// This can be achieved by creating a new array that filters out the selected character. 
// Once you have the new array, use it to set the team state.

// The character that was removed from the team state should be added to the zombieFighters array.
// Increase the money state by the price of the removed character, effectively refunding the cost to your budget.
// Ensure that the UI reflects the removal of the character from your team. 
// This includes updates to the total strength and agility displays, as well as the available money.


// Hints
// You should never change state directly. If you need to make a copy of an array, you can use the syntax const copyArray = [...sourceArray].
// You can use any method youâ€™d like to get the total strength and agility of the team - the arrayâ€™s reduce() method may be handy here, but any loop that will find the sum of these attributes will work.
// Optionally, if you want to add some polish to the app, you could replace the placeholder images with character images. An AI assistant may be helpful in this task.
// Optionally, you could also make it so a message displays in the browser when there isnâ€™t enough budget to add a team member.
